      <p><b>tad boy color... camera!</b></p>
      <p>Earlier I mentioned the new GBC format mod, the Tad Boy Color. Now, there is a new form fitting Game Boy Camera specifically designed for it! I am always fascinated by the creativity of hardware modders. <a href="https://gameboycamera.pika.page/posts/tad-boy-camera"> See the full details here in this blog post.</a></p>

      <h3>GBDK/GB Studio </h3>
<p>GBDK, the toolset I use to make my games, has been slowly expanded over the last couple years to create NES games and 6502. GB Studio, a popular drag-and-drop WYSIWYG game making app, uses GBDK as well, and so now it looks like you can use GB Studio to create NES games!</p>

      <p>For those of us who use GBDK or GB Studio, the NES is becoming a more attractive target platform. Not as ubiquitous as the Game Boy these days, but definetly a great way to grow your audience!</p>

      <h3>nostialgic and flavorful anime you can watch for free on youtube right now</h3>
      <p>Sometimes, I go trolling for anime on youtube. I like the idea of coming across hidden gems and discovering things which may be 30-40 years old but still have appeal and hold my attention, and charm me in some way or another. Here is a short list of some of the anime which has caught my attention. I'm recommending these for their aesthetic and entertainment value. I totally acknowledge the problematic things in 80s and 90s anime which do not need to be there and we'd now think of as offensive in a lot of contexts. At the same time, there are elements of the craft, narrative, and vibe you can enjoy if you decide not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Like crushing an entire pizza on a friday night, sometimes its alright to enjoy a little trash.</p>
      <p>I gave each of these an audience ratings, but keep in mind these are entirely subjective.</p>
      <h4>WINDARIA <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtFUzTsI2k">(e sub)</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q53_TxDbrs">(e dub)</a> - PG </h4>
      <p>Windaria is a ghibli-esque sweeping adventure about the rivalry between kingdoms. You can tell that for the time it was quite a large production.  The design shares visual motifs with Castle in the Sky and Nausicaa. There is a weave of fantasy and mythology tropes underneath the surface that do inspire complex feelings about what the main characters are going through. I'd only say this is for an older aucience because I doubt someone under 12 could really follow the plot.<p>
      <h4>LEGEND OF LEMNEAR <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qutzqKcipQQ">(e sub)</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/F7QsakjFxjw">(e dub)</a> - HARD R</h4>
      <p>Lemnear is schlock, but that being said, its my favorite kind of schlock. You could see it as a gender-bent anime version of Conan the Barbarian: its a sword and sorcery where the last-of-their-tribe take on the evil wizard who exterminated their people. Violence and sexual content.</p>
      <h4>BAOH - THE VISITOR <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCVw8Z_t7C8">(e sub)</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/rcfykg9jIZM">(e dub)</a> - HARD R</h4>
      <p>Again, its trash but its very good trash. A guy has alien superpowers, dark forces attempt to capture him and his ward. Strong violence.</p>
      <h4>GOLDEN BOY (j sub) (e dub) - SOFT R</h4>
      <p>Golden Boy is notorious for 1) being super horny 2) being hilarious. The main character is a polymathic knowledge sponge who goes from job to job in an attempt to soak up as much learning as possible. Over the course of 6 episodes he enounters different femme fatales who challenge him while he plays the clever underling. Nudity and sexual content.</p>
      <h4>AREA 88 / UN SQUADRON <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DA5QflpGHA">(e sub)</a> (e dub <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCbZU3KxvZcw">1+2</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kpv5nhFPbjU">3</a>) - PG-13</h4>
      <p>This one is about a guy who is drawn into being a mercenary pilot for a small, rich, Middle Eastern state. The world and circumstance they set up is pretty interesting, and the vehicle animation is 100% on point. The protagonists main plot of reuiniting with his beloved is enough to keep you invested until the end. PG-13 for mature story themes. The content is pretty mild for most standards.</p>
      <h4>SHERLOCK HOUND <a href="https://youtu.be/hRQSoaSZWpQ?si=F6rHURGvBjJpxexo">(e dub playlist)</a> - EVERYONE</h4>
      <p>I have a soft spot for Sherlock Hound in the same way that I have one for Star Trek: the Next Generation. Pastel colors, soothing soundscapes, quiet character moments, and an aesthetic filled with such gentility and craft, that if you're not admiring it, it'll lull you to sleep in the best and most comforting way. I often put on the series to either have something on in the background while I'm working or intentionally slip into a nap. The series was directed in part by a young Hayao Miyazaki. The animation quality is simple but consistently good and often impressive.</p>

      <h4>A.D. POLICE FILES (e dub <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6oIv3I8SDo">1</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUUHhFp6h9Y&t=6s">2</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVHQu7FV1ho">3</a>) - HARD R</h4>
      <p>Taking place in the cyberpunk world of BubbleGum Crisis (if you're unfamiliar, but you've seen Terminator, Blade Runner, or played Snatcher, you will get it quickly), it features 3 different short science fiction stories. Society tries to use cybernetics to make themselves better, but find that faulty or degrading augments caused by corporate or scientific overreach change their perceptions of reality, hijack their humanity, and none of these stories have happy endings. Strong violence.</p>
      <h4>VILGUST (e sub <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geywIlbq_1c">1</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hReIxHAb5Q">2</a>) - PG</h4>
      <p>Vilgust is what I would call a "RPG Fantasy", because the story and characters are directly inspired by an RPG of the same name. You have your characters who are all stereotypes of their class/jobs. You have the annoying catgirl, the ancient powerful evil threatening to take over the realm, etc, etc. I really enjoy it for its simplicity and how pretty is it. I like that you can see the grit in the grease pencil on the animation cels. Its got the same feel for me as watching Robin Hood on a VHS when you're on summer break.</p>
